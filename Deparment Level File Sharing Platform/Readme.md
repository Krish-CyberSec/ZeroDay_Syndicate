# 📘 Department-Level Secure Academic File Sharing System

A secure, role-based academic web portal built using **Python (Django)** that enables faculty and students to safely share notes and assignments within a university department. The system focuses on **security, controlled access, and real-world academic workflows**, complementing existing LMS platforms.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In many universities, academic files are shared using informal platforms such as WhatsApp, email, or USB drives, which introduces risks like malware propagation, unauthorized access, and lack of accountability.

This project provides a **secure, department-level solution** where:
- Only **college-created accounts** can access the system
- Faculty control which student groups receive documents
- Students can only access content meant for their academic group
- Files are validated using **file signature (magic bytes)** and **hashing (SHA-256 / MD5)** to prevent disguised malware uploads
- Students receive **notifications** for new notes and assignments

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### 1️⃣ Authentication & Authorization
- Django built-in authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Group-Based Access Control (branch, specialization, course, year)

---

### 2️⃣ Secure File Upload (Advanced Protection)

To prevent attackers from disguising malicious files by changing file extensions, the system uses **three-layer file validation**:

#### ✅ Layer 1: File Extension Check
- Allowed: `.pdf`, `.docx`
- Not trusted alone

#### ✅ Layer 2: MIME Type Check
- Checks OS-reported file type
- Can be spoofed

#### 🔥 Layer 3: File Signature (Magic Byte) Validation
Validates the actual file content.

| File Type | Magic Bytes |
|----------|-------------|
| PDF | `%PDF-` |
| EXE | `MZ` |
| ZIP / DOCX | `PK` |

❌ Example: A `.pdf` file starting with `MZ` is blocked.

### 3️⃣ File Hashing (SHA-256 / MD5)
- Hash generated on upload
- Hash stored in database
- Hash verified on download
- Ensures file integrity and tamper detection
